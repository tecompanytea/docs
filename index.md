## About Té Company

Té Company is a New York-based specialty tea company founded in 2012 by Elena Liao and Frederico Ribeiro.

We source loose-leaf teas directly from small farmers in Taiwan and create handmade traditional treats in our Brooklyn bakery. The name "Té" comes from the word for tea in Taiwanese Hokkien, a Chinese dialect spoken by over 70% of the population in Taiwan.

### Our Mission

- **Direct sourcing** from Taiwanese tea farmers
- **Handmade quality** with no artificial preservatives
- **Community & craft** through meaningful collaborations
- **Education** about tea culture and brewing

## Our Philosophy

### Direct Sourcing
We travel to Taiwan regularly to source tea directly from small farmers. This allows us to build long-term relationships, understand terroir and processing methods, ensure quality, and share the stories behind each tea.

### Handmade Quality
Our pastries are made to order with no artificial preservatives. We use traditional methods combined with the best local ingredients to create treats that are both nostalgic and delicious.

### Community & Craft
Each anniversary, we collaborate with artisans outside our wheelhouse to create functional, beautiful objects for teatime:
- **Year 8**: Portuguese linen tea towels made by seamstress Emilia
- **Year 9**: Embroidered baseball caps from NYC embroidery shop  
- **Year 10**: Handmade tea cups by Natalie Pappas of Youlan Ceramics
