In this guide we are using [Canyon Green](https://tecompanytea.com/collections/tea/products/canyon-green), which has a twisted leaf shape. Twisted leaf tea (e.g., Canyon Green or Oriental Beauty) steeps faster than rolled leaf tea (e.g., Frozen Summit) so the brewing time should be closer to 1 minute instead of 2. With the ratio we provided (6 grams of tea and 15 oz of water), we suggest 3 steepings using the same tea leaves, but feel free to adjust according to your preference. We recommend completing all your steepings within the day.

## Equipment
- Loose leaf tea
- [Hario Tea Server Simply](https://tecompanytea.com/collections/tea-accessories/products/hario-tea-server-simply) (450 ml / 15 oz / ~2 cups)
- Kitchen scale
- Cups for sharing

## Brewing Time
- 1-2 minutes, depending on the tea and personal taste.
- You can re-steep the tea leaves for at least 2-3 more times, so don't discard the leaves right after the first infusion.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Weigh Tea Leaves
Weigh out 6 grams of oolong tea. Using a scale ensures you have the right amount of tea, regardless of the shape and size of the leaves.

### Step 2: Rinse and Preheat
Use hot water (195, 200, or 212 °F) to rinse your Hario Tea Server. This is the same temperature you will use to brew the tea. Preheating the vessel to your intended brewing temperature allows for more precise brewing. Please refer to individual tea pages for suggested brewing temperature by tea.

### Step 3: Add Tea
Pour out the water. Add the loose leaf tea to your Hario Tea Server. The preheated teapot will help the tea leaves release their aroma and flavor more effectively.

### Step 4: Add Water
Add water to your tea. Generally, the water should be lower (~195 °F) for twisted tea leaves and higher (~212 °F) for tightly rolled tea leaves. Please refer to individual tea pages for suggested brewing temperature by tea.

### Step 5: Swirl
Make sure the tea leaves are wet evenly, gently swirling your vessel if necessary.

### Step 6: Let the Tea Brew
Brew for 1 minute. For tightly rolled tea leaves we prefer a longer steeping time of 2 minutes. Use this time to heat up the pitcher and teacups.

### Step 7: Strain
Hario tea server simply has a built-in mesh, making it very easy to strain.
When the steeping time is up, pour the tea into a pitcher or a mug. Make sure all the liquid is drained from the teapot. That way the tea doesn't over-brew and become bitter when you go back for subsequent steepings. To ensure there is no small tea residue in your brew, consider using a fine mesh tea strainer.

### Step 8: Enjoy
Pour your tea and enjoy!
Re-steep the tea as many times as you fancy. We recommend three in total for this tea-to-water ratio. To re-steep, simply add more water. The second steep's suggested brewing time is the same as the first and the third should be 1-2 minutes longer.
