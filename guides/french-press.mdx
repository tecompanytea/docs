# Brew Tea in a French Press

There is nothing better than a homemade cup of tea.

In this guide we are using [Jade Rouge](https://tecompanytea.com/collections/black-tea/products/red-jade-black-tea) oolong, which has a twisted leaf shape. Twisted leaf tea (e.g., Jade Rouge or [Oriental Beauty](https://tecompanytea.com/collections/oolong-tea/products/oriental-beauty-oolong)) steeps faster than rolled leaf tea (e.g., Frozen Summit) so the brewing time should be closer to 1 minute instead of 2. With the ratio we provided (6 grams of tea and 8 oz of water), we suggest 3 steepings using the same tea leaves, but feel free to adjust according to your preference. We recommend completing all your steepings within the day.

## Equipment
- Loose leaf tea
- French press (~8 oz water)
- Kitchen scale
- [Pitcher](https://tecompanytea.com/products/porcelain-tea-pitcher) and [teacups](https://tecompanytea.com/products/porcelain-tea-cups) for sharing, or a large mug to enjoy solo

## Brewing Time
- 1-2 minutes, depending on the tea and personal taste.
- You can re-steep the tea leaves for at least 2-3 more times, so don't discard the leaves right after the first infusion.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Weigh Tea Leaves
Weigh out 6 grams of tea.

### Step 2: Rinse and Preheat
Use hot water (195, 200, or 212 °F) to rinse your Vessel. This is the same temperature you will use to brew the tea. Heating the jar to your intended brewing temperature will allow more precise brewing temperature. Please refer to individual tea pages for suggested brewing temperature by tea.

### Step 3: Add Tea
Pour out the water. Add the loose leaf tea.

### Step 4: Add Water
Add water to your tea. Generally, the water should be lower (~195 °F) for twisted tea leaves and higher (~212 °F) for tightly rolled tea leaves. Pour the water in a circular motion to ensure all the tea leaves are being properly hydrated.

### Step 5: Let it Brew
Put the lid back on to the French press. Don't plunge all the way down.
We want to use the French press as a strainer. Not plunging all the way will ensure the tea leaves have a lot of room to expand, therefore releasing the maximum amount of flavor.

### Step 6: Strain
When the steeping time is over. Put a strainer on top of your pitcher and carefully pour the tea out of the jar.

### Step 7: Enjoy
Pour the tea into your cups and enjoy!
Re-steep the tea as many times as you fancy. We recommend three in total for this tea-to-water ratio. To re-steep simply add more water. The second steep's suggested brewing time is the same as the first and the third should be 1-2 minutes longer.

## Notes on French Press for Tea
If you also use it for making coffee, make sure to clean it very well (especially the filter) otherwise your tea may taste like coffee. You could also just use the glass base of a French press and use a separate strainer (a fork would do if you don't have a strainer) to strain the leaves.
