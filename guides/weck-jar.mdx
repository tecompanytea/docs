# Brew Tea in a Weck Jar

There is nothing better than a homemade cup of tea.

In this guide we are brewing our [Baozhong](https://tecompanytea.com/products/baozhong-tea) oolong tea, which has a twisted leaf shape. Twisted leaf tea (e.g., Baozhong or [Jade Rouge](https://tecompanytea.com/collections/black-tea/products/red-jade-black-tea)) steeps faster than rolled leaf tea (e.g., [Frozen Summit](https://tecompanytea.com/collections/tea/products/frozen-summit-tea)) so the brewing time should be closer to 1 minute instead of 2. With the ratio we provided (6 grams of tea and 8 oz of water), we suggest 3 steepings using the same tea leaves, but feel free to adjust according to your preference. We recommend completing all your steepings within the day. Our suggested steeping time can vary by tea, though don't be shy to experiment. Try and see what works for your palate.

## Equipment
- Loose leaf tea
- Weck or Mason jar (~8 oz water)
- Kitchen scale
- [Pitcher](https://tecompanytea.com/products/porcelain-tea-pitcher) and [teacups](https://tecompanytea.com/products/porcelain-tea-cups) for sharing, or a large mug to enjoy solo
- [Strainer](https://tecompanytea.com/products/metal-tea-strainer)

## Brewing Time
- 1-2 minutes, depending on the tea and personal taste.
- You can re-steep the tea leaves for at least 2-3 more times, so don't discard the leaves right after the first infusion.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Weigh Tea Leaves
Weigh out 6 grams of tea.

### Step 2: Rinse and Preheat
Use hot water (195, 200, or 212 °F) to rinse your Weck or Mason jar. This is the same temperature you will use to brew the tea. Heating the jar to your intended brewing temperature will allow more precise brewing temperature. Please refer to individual tea pages for suggested brewing temperature by tea.

### Step 3: Add Tea
Pour out the water. Add the loose leaf tea to your jar.

### Step 4: Add Water
Add water to your tea. Generally, the water should be lower (~195 °F) for twisted tea leaves and higher (~212 °F) for tightly rolled tea leaves. Pour the water in a circular motion to ensure all the tea leaves are being properly hydrated. Cover your vessel to maintain temperature.

### Step 5: Brewing
Make sure the tea leaves are wet evenly, using a spoon if necessary to stir the loose tea leaves. The loose leaf tea leaves will expand. Let the tea brew for the necessary amount of time.

### Step 6: Strain
When the steeping time is over. Put a strainer on top of your pitcher and carefully pour the tea out of the jar.

### Step 7: Remove Strainer
You will notice some loose leaf tea leaves in the strainer. Remove the strainer from the pitcher.

### Step 8: Enjoy
Pour the tea in cups and enjoy.
