# Steep Tea with no Tools

There is nothing better than a homemade cup of tea. This method can be utilized in the most desperate of situations since it uses no tools, just a mug and your teeth.

## Equipment
- Loose leaf tea
- Kettle
- Cup or large mug

## Brewing Time
- 1-2 minutes, depending on the tea and personal taste.
- You can re-steep the tea leaves for at least 2-3 more times, so don't discard the leaves right after the first infusion.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Measure Tea Leaves
Use your hand to measure the tea. Approximation works because if it's too strong you can add more water and if it's too light, you can increase steeping time. Add loose leaf tea directly into the cup.

### Step 2: Add Tea to Cup
Add loose leaf tea directly into the cup.

### Step 3: Pour Water
Pour hot water (195, 200, or 212 °F) directly onto the leaves. Please refer to individual tea pages for suggested brewing temperature by tea.

### Step 4: Let it Brew
You will see the tea leaves expand and start to sink to the bottom of the cup.

### Step 5: Drink
Drink directly from the cup. If necessary use your teeth as a strainer.

### Step 6: Add More Water
Like any other loose leaf tea, brewing more than once is recommended. Just add hot water.

### Step 7: Add More Water
The more steepings are made, the more the leaves sink to the bottom of the cup, making it easier to drink.

### Pro Tip
Add hot water for your subsequent steepings when you have about 1/3 of the tea left. The bottom of the infusion tends to get more concentrated since we aren't straining the teas.
By the time you get to the end of the infusion, the tea is also no longer hot. By adding hot water when about 1/3 of the previous infusion remains, your next cup of tea will be perfect in strength and temperature.
