# Té Company

> Taiwanese tea and handmade tea snacks sourced directly from small farmers in Taiwan.

Té Company is a New York-based specialty tea company founded in 2012. We have two tearooms in Manhattan (West Village and East Village) and source loose-leaf teas directly from Taiwan. We're known for our Pineapple Linzer cookies, named "New York's Best Cookie" by Saveur and featured in the New York Times.
